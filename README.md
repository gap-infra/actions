# GAP-and-packages integration tests

The purpose of this repository is to test various aspects of GAP and its packages.

To some degree, the tests in this repository should help us detect:
* Has GAP broken a package?
* Has a package broken GAP?
* Has one package broken itself or another package? (Somewhat).

[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FriedrichRober/integration/data/badges/badge.json)](https://github.com/FriedrichRober/integration/actions/workflows/pkg-master-caller.yml) [Report is here](https://friedrichrober.github.io/integration/)

The tests of whether GAP has broken itself currently exist in the main [gap-system/gap](https://github.com/gap-system/gap) repository.


## High-level status dashboard

This is an attempt to replicate a dashboard like the one that existed at <https://github.com/gap-system/gap-distribution/blob/master/README.md>. We hope to provide much more fine-grained status information, in the longer term.

This also serves as an easy entry to manually dispatch small subsets of these jobs.
